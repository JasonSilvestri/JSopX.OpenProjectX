The purpose of this effort is not only to highlight design patterns & best practices, but also foster a collaborative environment for developers like you and me to elevate their skills and secure their applications on an enterprise-level. 

**Together**, let's redefine **mobile**, **web** & **desktop** application development on an **enterprise-level**, ensuring our apps are as robust and secure - as they are innovative.


# Getting Quick Started:

> [!WARNING]
> **Advanced Developers Only:**
> If you are new to this project suite, it is recommended that you skip to the [JSopX™ Project Technology Requirements](#jsopx-project-technology-requirements) section.

**This `Quick Start` section assumes you have already done the following:**

1. You are familar with the `JasonSilvestri` GitHub and understand what `repositories` are as a whole.
2. You already have installed or checked that you have the minimum [JSopX™ Project Technology Requirements](#jsopx-project-technology-requirements).
3. You have at least reviewed the [JSopX™ Project Respositories](#jsopx-project-repositories).


## Quick Start : Option 1: Get an `All-In-One` Copy of Git Repository

This approach allows you to `clone` the _primary_ `JSopX.OpenProjectX` Git Repository to get all projects under one solution. 

1. _Clone_ `JSopX.OpenProjectX` Git Repository:
      
    ```bash
       # Using Bash to clone JSopX.OpenProjectX Git Repository
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.OpenProjectX.git
    ```

## Quick Start : Option 2: Get an `Independent` Copy of a Git Repository

This approach allows you to clone one or more Git Repositories as `Independent` Project Repositories.

2. _Clone_ `One` or `More` Git Repositories:
      
    ```bash
   
       # Using Bash to clone one or more JSopX Git Repositories
   
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar.git
      
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.ClassLibrary.git
      
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.WebAPI.git
      
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.SharedResources.git
      
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.RCLxProper.git
      
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.RCLxAssets.git
      
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.RCLxComponents.git
      
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.AngularCore.git
      
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.ReactCore.git
      
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.VueCore.git
      
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.AspNetCore.git
      
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopx.BlazorServerCore.git
      
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.MauiHybridNetCore.git
   
    ```

## Get Started : Option 3: (Recommended) `Technology Requirements`

# Overview
###### Why the JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences Collection is Different

In a world where client-side frameworks like Angular & React now dominate, with NO-SQL Databases set to _transitional-slacker-mode_, and certain developers set to _spagetti-mode_, it is no surprise that just about every day now you hear about all the hacks, data breaches, and downed apps across device, space & time. Don't get me wrong. _Nobody is perfect!_ Everyone makes mistakes. You also can't know everything. I am still in discovery with some of these technologies myself, and at the end of the day, there will always be a designer, engineer, architect or hacker better than you or me. However, there is a difference between making mistakes while trying to do what is best for your team and the business, and making mistakes you know you could have avoided and instead chose self preservation. Then there is, of course, sometimes we just didn't know better.

My JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences Collection is an attempt at doing my part in helping the community to bridge the **critical gap** between front-end dynamism and back-end security, and aim to demonstrate how to effectively integrate client-side frameworks with robust server-side operations and similar resources, following Multi-Platform, Multi-Stack & Enterprise-Level industry standards and best practices. 

Conversely, this street goes both ways (_by design_). I also need your help _calling me out_ if you think something I suggest isn't accurate based on your experience and/or to let me know if there is a bug or problem in one or more projects involved in this solution that I overlooked. The best thing any of us can do is collaborate, especially if it is going to help others get to where we are in this space. 

# High-Level Tech Highlights
###### JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences Collection is a Multi-Platform, Multi-Stack Enterprise-Level Application Suite

With over a dozen well oiled client-side and server-side projects deployable with a click of a button, JSopX.OpenProjectX includes:

- The best of `Asp.NET Core`server-side security and implementation, combined with client-side based `Angular`, `React`, `Vue`, `Blazor` & `.NET MAUi Hybrid` application development technology stacks,
- all projects using the _same_ `WebAPI`,
- the _same_ `creative design`, `resources` and `assets`,
- the _same_ `Class Libraries` & `Razor Class Libraries`,
- and all available as:
    - A `responsive design` browser-based `web application` tailored for most major `phones`, `tablets`, `laptops` & `desktop computers`,
    - A `desktop application` for `Windows`, `Linux` & `Mac`,
    - and `native mobile apps` in `iPhone`, `Android`, `Samsung Galaxy` & `Windows Phone`.

# Prerequisites
###### Requirements or conditions that must be met before starting.
I know the average developer loves to just `Rambo It!`, by jumping in, guns blazing, and I get all that most of the time. Conversely, we need to remember that this is a multi-platform, multi-stack, enterprise-level application, made up of over a dozen different projects and technologies. You need to try and ensure you have the latest across the board for maximum results.

### JSopX™ GitHub Repositories : Overview

All JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences live as `JSopX™ GitHub Repositories` on `GitHub`, a popular source control platform, much like `DevOps Team Foundation`.

This section is dedicated to helping you retrieve the correct `JSopX™ GitHub Repositories`, using a variety tools that have similar approaches to doing things like `cloning`.

It is important you at least get a glimpse at some of these tools, because you will see them used. 

<br/>

[All Technology Requirements](#jsopx-project-technology-requirements)  »  [**JSopX™ GitHub Repositories**](#jsopx-github-repositories)  »  [Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

<br/>

  
## JSopX™ GitHub Repositories: Cloning:

When you `clone` a JSopX™ GitHub Repository, you are essentially downloading a copy of the associated projects and/or solutions within that repository. I will use one of my projects as an example.

### Using JSopX.RCLxComponents Repository as Example Clone

**`JSopX.RCLxComponents.sln`**: The `JSopX.RCLxComponents` Project (_JSopX™ Razor Class Library "xComponents" Project_) is a Razor Class Library focusing on reusable Blazor and MAUI components, with plans for experimental support for Vue, React, and Angular components.

In this example, we know the `JSopX.RCLxComponents` project is a very cool and helpful Razor Class Library we want to consume. It is time to `clone` it.

#### Step by Step Instructions:
So, typically when you see people trying to be GitHub cool, they will often provide you a one-liner `clone` example, which ultimately translates to using the `Bash` command line tool. 

1. _Clone_ `JSopX.RCLxComponents` Git Repository using `Bash` Command Line:
   
   - This typical example looks something the following:
     
       ```bash
       # Using Bash to clone JSopX.RCLxComponents Git Repository
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.RCLxComponents.git
       ```

   - However, this isn't technically accurate. You want to first go to a location on your local computer where you actually want the project to be cloned to, once it is pulled from the remote version on GitHub.
   
   - This most accurately depicts the correct example:
       ```bash
       # Navigate to local desired directory to the repository
       $ cd path\to\local\repo\JSopX.RCLxComponents
   
       # Using Bash to clone JSopX.RCLxComponents Git Repository
       # Navigate to remote desired directory to the repository
       
       $ git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.RCLxComponents.git
       ```

2. _Clone_ `JSopX.RCLxComponents` Git Repository using  the Command Line tool, `PowerShell`:
          
   - **PowerShell**:
       
       ```powershell
       # Navigate to the desired local directory you plan to clone the repository to on your computer
       cd path\to\local\repo\JSopX.RCLxComponents
   
       # Using PowerShell to clone JSopX.RCLxComponents Git Repository
       git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.RCLxComponents.git
       ```


3. _Clone_ `JSopX.RCLxComponents` Git Repository using  the Command Line tool, `Node.js Command Line`:
       
   - **npm (Using Node.js Command Line)**:
       If you want to clone a repository directly from the `Node.js` command line, you can use `npx`:
   
       ```node
       // Navigate to the desired directory
       cd path\to\local\repo\JSopX.RCLxComponents
   
       // Using npx to clone JSopX.RCLxComponents Git Repository
       npx degit JasonSilvestri/JSopX.RCLxComponents
       ```
   
       **Explanation**:
       `npx degit` is a tool that allows you to clone a repository without including the `.git` folder. It's useful for creating a fresh start without any history, which can be handy for scaffolding projects.

       - **Vite (After CLoning)**:
       If you want to clone a repository directly and then use tools like `Vite` (_what we use in Vue to handle certain build aspects_), from the `Bash` command line, you can use `npx`:

   - **Vite** (After Cloning):
       ```bash
       # Navigate to the desired directory
       cd path\to\local\repo\JSopX.RCLxComponents
   
       # Clone the repository using Bash
       git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.RCLxComponents.git
   
       # Navigate to the cloned directory
       cd JSopX.RCLxComponents
   
       # Initialize or install the project with Vite
       npm create vite@latest
       npm install
       ```
   
      ### Summary:
       - **PowerShell** and **Bash** both use `git clone` after navigating to the local directory.
       - **npm** (or `npx`) can use the `degit` command to clone a repository directly.
       - **Vite** steps show initializing or installing the project after cloning.
       
3. _Open_ the solution in `Visual Studio`:

    - **Open** `RCLxComponents.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 or higher.

4. _Build_ the `Project`:

    - **Right-click** on the solution in `Solution Explorer` and select `Build Solution`.

## Visual Studio: Checking Versions

Check if `Visual Studio` v **`17.10.3`** (_or higher_) is installed on your device.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

Use **`Powershell`** Command Line dialog to ensure you have the correct version of `Visual Studio` v `17.10.3` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `Powershell`, type the following command, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:
   
   ```powershell
      # Using Powershell:
      # Check Visual Studio version
   
      dotnet --version
    ```
   
2. This command checks the `version` of `Visual Studio` on your device, and then prints back your version to the `Powershell` Command Line dialog output.
   
3. If you have version `Visual Studio` v **`17.10.3`** (_or higher_), you are _good to go_, and no further action is needed!
   
If you do not have Visual Studio installed or you version is **`lower`** than `Visual Studio` v **`17.10.3`**, it is recommended that you install it _immediately_ to avoid unexpected results.

1. Open `Powershell`, type the following _command_, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:

   ```powershell   
      # Using Powershell:
      # Install Visual Studio 2022 using the Visual Studio Installer (community edition as an example)

      Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_community.exe" -OutFile "vs_community.exe"
      Start-Process -FilePath "vs_community.exe" -ArgumentList "--quiet --wait --norestart" -Wait
    ```

## .NET Core MAUI Hybrid: Checking Versions

Check if `.NET Core MAUI Hybrid` v **`8.0.3`** (_or higher_) is installed on your device.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

Use **`Powershell`** Command Line dialog to ensure you have the correct version of `.NET Core MAUI Hybrid` v `8.0.3` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `Powershell`, type the following command, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:
   
   ```powershell
      # Using Powershell:
      # Check .NET Core MAUI Hybrid version
   
      dotnet --list-sdks
    ```
   
2. This command checks the `version` of `.NET Core MAUI Hybrid` on your device, and then prints back your version to the `Powershell` Command Line dialog output.
   
3. If you have version `.NET Core MAUI Hybrid` v **`8.0.3`** (_or higher_), you are _good to go_, and no further action is needed!
   
If you do not have .NET Core MAUI Hybrid installed or you version is **`lower`** than `.NET Core MAUI Hybrid` v **`8.0.3`**, it is recommended that you install it _immediately_ to avoid unexpected results.

## Vue: Checking Versions

Check if `Vue` v **`3.4.21`** (_or higher_) is installed on your device.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

Use **`Node`** Command Line dialog to ensure you have the correct version of `Vue` v `3.4.21` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `npm`, type the following command, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:
   
   ```node
      // Using npm:
      // Check Vue version
      npm list vue
    ```
   
2. This command checks the `version` of `Vue` on your device, and then prints back your version to the `Vue` Command Line dialog output.
   
3. If you have version `Vue` v **`3.4.21`** (_or higher_), you are _good to go_, and no further action is needed!
   
If you do not have Vue installed or you version is **`lower`** than `Vue` v **`3.4.21`**, it is recommended that you install it _immediately_ to avoid unexpected results.

## JSopX™ Open Project EXperience: Option 2: _Each Project Independently_

> [!TIP]
> **All Projects Work Independently:**
> 
> All projects also work independently from one another. So, there is no reason why you couldn't, for example, clone the `JSopX.AngularCore` Project to see how it works, and then the `JSopX.WebAPI` for the same reason sometime later (_or vica-versa_).
>
> When you are ready to ingest all projects at once, you can just clone the [All-In-One JSopX™ Open Project EXperience](#jsopx-open-project-experience-all-in-one).
 
For the mostpart, these project are organized in the order they were created:

### Overview: JSopX™ to Replace Sub Modules with Git Subtree

`Git Subtree` is an alternative to `Git Submodule` for including one repository as a subdirectory of another repository. Unlike submodules, subtrees do not require special handling when cloning, fetching, or pushing changes, making them easier to manage in complex projects.

By using `Git Subtree`, we can keep our projects like `JSopX.OpenProjectX`, `JSopX.WebAPI`, and `JSopX.SharedResources` separate, allowing for independent development, while still being able to include them as part of a larger project.

## Git Subtree Implementation

> [!WARNING]
> Again, this document is for **advanced users only**, and outlines the steps to implement `Git Subtree` for managing your repositories like `JSopX.OpenProjectX`, and how sub tree projects, like `JSopX.WebAPI`, and `JSopX.SharedResources` work in this unique solution.
> 
> **Please ensure that all collaborators understand how to use Git Subtree to avoid potential conflicts.**

### Adding a Subtree

To `add` a repository as a subtree, use the following command:

```powershell
git subtree add --prefix=local/repos/JSopX.WebAPI https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.WebAPI.git master --squash
```

This command adds the `JSopX.WebAPI` repository as a subtree in the `JSopX.OpenProjectX` repository, under the `local/repos/JSopX.WebAPI` directory.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Pulling in Updates

To `pull` in updates from the remote subtree repository, use the following command:

```powershell
git subtree pull --prefix=local/repos/JSopX.WebAPI https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.WebAPI.git master --squash
```

This `pulls` the latest changes from the `master` branch of the `JSopX.WebAPI` repository and merges them into your local project.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Pushing Subtree Changes

To `push` changes made in the subtree back to the remote repository, use:

```powershell
git subtree push --prefix=local/repos/JSopX.WebAPI https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.WebAPI.git master
```

This command pushes any changes made in the `local/repos/JSopX.WebAPI` directory back to the `master` branch of the `JSopX.WebAPI` repository.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Removing a Subtree

If you need to remove a subtree, you can simply delete the directory and clean up the Git history:

```powershell
rm -rf local/repos/JSopX.WebAPI
git add .
git commit -m "Removed JSopX.WebAPI subtree"
```

This will remove the subtree and commit the changes to your repository.

## Benefits of Using Git Subtree

- **Simplified Workflow**: Unlike submodules, subtrees don’t require additional steps when cloning, fetching, or pushing changes. Everything is handled through regular Git commands.
- **Independent Repos**: Each project (e.g., `JSopX.WebAPI`, `JSopX.SharedResources`) remains a fully independent Git repository that can be worked on separately.
- **Unified History**: Subtrees merge the history of the subtree repositories into the main repository, making it easier to track changes across the entire project.
- **No Submodule Confusion**: Avoids the common pitfalls of Git Submodules, such as detached HEAD states and complex update mechanisms.

### Summary of the Issue
You're facing an issue where a submodule project (`JSopX.ClassLibrary`) nested within another submodule (`JSopX.WebAPI`), which in turn is nested within a parent project (`JSopX.OpenProjectX`), fails to restore correctly in Visual Studio. The error message suggests that the project file for the submodule cannot be found, even though the file exists in the specified location.

### Possible Causes
#### 1. **Conflicting Project Names**: 
   - Having the same project name (`JSopX.ClassLibrary`) across multiple tiers might be causing conflicts during the restore process. Visual Studio and Git might be getting confused about which `JSopX.ClassLibrary` to reference.

#### 2. **Git Submodule Handling**: 
   - Git submodules are tricky, especially when nested deeply. The issue might stem from how Git handles the relative paths and references in submodules. If the `.gitmodules` file isn’t configured correctly, it could lead to issues when trying to restore or build the project.

#### 3. **Project File Paths**: 
   - Visual Studio sometimes struggles with long or complex file paths, especially when multiple layers of submodules are involved. The error you're seeing could be a result of this complexity.

#### 4. **Solution Structure**: 
   - The new structure, where the solution and project are in separate but similarly named directories, could be adding to the confusion, especially when combined with submodules.

### Potential Solutions
#### 1. **Rename Submodules to Avoid Conflicts**
   - Consider renaming the submodules to ensure that each has a unique name across all tiers. For example, you could name the nested `JSopX.ClassLibrary` something like `JSopX.WebAPI.ClassLibrary` to avoid conflicts.

#### 2. **Check `.gitmodules` Configuration**
   - Ensure that the `.gitmodules` file is correctly configured, especially the paths for each submodule. If needed, manually adjust the paths to be absolute or relative to the parent project.

#### 3. **Flatten the Project Structure**
   - Consider flattening the project structure to reduce the depth of submodules. For example, instead of nesting `JSopX.ClassLibrary` within `JSopX.WebAPI` and then within `JSopX.OpenProjectX`, you could try referencing `JSopX.ClassLibrary` directly from `JSopX.OpenProjectX` without the intermediate nesting.

#### 4. **Use Git Subtree Instead of Submodule**
   - Git subtree could be an alternative to submodules. It allows you to pull in the contents of one repository into a subdirectory of another repository, which might simplify the structure and avoid some of the issues with submodule nesting.

#### 5. **Manual Project File Updates**
   - If Visual Studio is having trouble resolving the project references, try manually editing the `.csproj` and `.sln` files to ensure that the paths are correct. You might need to use relative paths that reflect the actual structure of your repositories.

#### 6. **Separate the Projects**
   - As a last resort, consider splitting the projects entirely so that each project is independent and not nested within another. This would eliminate the issue of nested submodules but might complicate your overall project structure.

### Next Steps
1. **Check and Rename**: Start by checking the `.gitmodules` file and considering a renaming strategy to avoid conflicts.
2. **Test with Git Subtree**: If renaming doesn't solve the issue, try switching to Git subtree for managing dependencies.
3. **Flatten Structure**: If the issue persists, look into flattening the structure or separating the projects to reduce complexity.

# JSopX™ Open Project EXperience Installation
###### I kept my fellow developers in mind, from start-to-finish, throughout the entire Development Lifecycle

For educational purposes, the **`JSopX.OpenProjectX`** (_JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences Collection Project_), was specifically designed to help developers along every step of the way, throughout the entire Development Lifecycle. 

One of the many ways I was thinking of my fellow developers was giving them the ability to `clone`, `run` and `deploy`, **_one_**, **_more_**, or **_ALL_** projects, using a _dual_ approach to repository management.

Working with **JSopX.OpenProjectX** `GitHub Repositories` and associated `Visual Studios Projects` derived from a singular repository, I was able to produce, both, an `All-In-One` and `Each Project Independently` version of the `JSopX.OpenProjectX` Project that achieves these goals.  

#### JSopX.OpenProjectX: Option 1: _All-In-One_

- An `All-In-One` version of the **`JSopX.OpenProjectX`** repository, in the form of a `Git Sub Tree`, and includes ALL major JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences Projects in one, unified, Enterprise-Level, Multi-Platform, Multi-Stack Solution.
  
- See the [JSopX.OpenProjectX: Option 1: _All-In-One_ Section](#jsopxopenprojectx--option-1-all-in-one) section below for details.

#### JSopX.OpenProjectX: Option 2: _Each Project Independently_

- An `Each Project Independently` version of the **`JSopX.OpenProjectX`** repository, which allows developers to explore each project independently, so you can explore the projects that interest you most, while not overwelming yourself with projects that don't. Conversely, the whole purpose for developing the JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences Collection was to broaden developer's sphere of infleunce, and in a rather extraordnary way, across platform, across stack, across device. Take all the time you need, but you should explore all projects eventually.
  
- See the [JSopX.OpenProjectX: Option 2: _Each Project Independently_ Section](#jsopx-open-project-experience-option-2-each-project-independently) section below for details.

> [!WARNING]
> **Above Approach Not Comnmon:**
> 
> This _dual_ approach with offering **JSopX.OpenProjectX** `GitHub Repositories` and associated `Visual Studios Projects` as, both, `All-In-One` and `Each Project Independently` versions, derived from a singular repository is **not common** and **difficult to manage** in certain instances.
>
> In a production setting, I would recommend _one_ approach or the _other_. In this case, where I wanted to make sure developers had the ability to ingest the code in the way they would prefer when dealing with an Enterprise-Level project, regardless of skill level, the business requirements called for something more.

## JSopX.OpenProjectX : Option 1: _All-In-One_

For educational purposes, the JSopX™ Open Project EXperience was specifically designed to allow fellow developers the ability to retrieve an `All-In-One` version of the repository as a Git Sub Tree.

The project is organized into the following structure:

> [!CAUTION]
> **Git Sub Tree:**
> 
> If you are not familar with Git Sub Trees, it is recommended to become familar for best results. I created a super easy section below. See, [Git Subtree Implementation](#git-subtree-implementation) for details.
